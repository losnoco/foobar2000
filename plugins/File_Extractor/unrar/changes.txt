Changes to UnRAR source
-----------------------
This library is based on UnRAR (unrarsrc-3.7.8.tar.gz) by Alexander L.
Roshal. The original sources have been HEAVILY modified, trimmed down,
and purged of all OS-specific calls for file access and other
unnecessary operations. Support for encryption, recovery records, and
volumes has been REMOVED.

The source is as close as possible to the original, to make it simple to
update it when a new version of UnRAR comes out. In many places the
original names and object nesting are kept, even though it's a bit
harder to follow. See rar.hpp for the main "glue".

The biggest change was converting error handling from exceptions to
longjmp. I had to carefully avoid local objects with destructors, since
they would leak during a longjmp. I also made reading in arcread.cpp
more robust. If any headers are cut off or the file doesn't end cleanly
after a block, the archive is considered corrupt.

Non-class array allocations now use malloc(), allowing the code to be
linked without the standard C++ library (particularly, operator new).
Class object allocations use a class-specific allocator that just calls
malloc(), also avoiding calls to operator new.

Several .cpp files are #included by others. This means you can't compile
them directly, complicating the build process and producing obscure
errors if you accidentally try to compile one. I added  #ifdef
RAR_COMMON_HPP guards on these to avoid this problem.
