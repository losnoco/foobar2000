/*
 * DLL Manager class v1.2 - 2010-11-03 06:23 UTC 
 *
 * "Clean" multi-instance DLL loader for libraries which only support one static
 * global instance internally.
 * 
 * Without the unique flag, it acts as little more than a synchronized DLL loader.
 *
 * When unique is set, modules which are already imported into the current address
 * space will be copied to a new file so the import will get a fresh instance of
 * the module. When the handle is passed to free(), or when the dll_manager is
 * destroyed, all temporary modules will be unloaded and destroyed.
