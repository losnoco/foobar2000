1.4 (Apr 24 2004):

1) Switched to using actual played amount to calculate update point.  i.e., Previously,
the percentage complete was based on position in the track; once the seekbar passed
the set percentage amount, the update took place.  Now, the update only happens when
the correct percentage has actually been played.

2) Fix issue when "Restart playback after restart" is on, and Foobar is shutdown while
a track is playing, after restart, the counter could have been updated twice.  This was
actually fixed by change #1 (above).

3) Added option in preferences to disable skipping of tracks not in the DB.


1.3 (Apr 16 2004):

1) Added support for specifying the date/time tags and format.  The tag name can be
specified, or left blank to skip.  For either field, a format string can be specified.

1.2 (Apr 14 2004):

1) Replaced option to update at play start vs completion with a slider bar so that
a playback percentage can be specified instead.


1.1 (Apr 14 2004):

1) Added option to update counter when playback starts (as opposed to when playback 
completes).  If disabled, the counter does not update until playback completes normally;
manually stopping playback (or switching to another track) will not update the counter.

2) Added "DB only mask" to compensate for lack of support for determining files that
don't support tags.  i.e., WAV files.  In version 1.0, a DB update was done for all
files, but this only defers updating the file (the next tag update will also write
the play counters).  The default value is "*.wav", which will cause it to not attempt
updates to WAV files.  If the method used in 1.0 is desired, a mask of *.* can be
used instead.
