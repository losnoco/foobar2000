1.  It expects to find "Frontend.h" from the Winamp SDK, and "Vis.h" from
  the Winamp vis_MiniSDK somewhere in the include directories listed in
  the project settings.  The Winamp headers can be taken care of by
  putting them in the same directory as these files.

2.  The include paths expect the SDK directory to be just outside the
  project directory, just like my setup:

      (base)\PFC
      (base)\Foobar2000\SDK
      (base)\Foobar2000\foo_vis_bacon

  - IMPORTANT NOTE:  I renamed Vis.h from the Winamp vis_MiniSDK to wvis.h
    to avoid confusion with the foobar header vis.h.  You'll have to, too.

3.  foo_osd.cpp and foo_osd.h expose the GUIDs for foo_osd's menu commands
  and provide a class for disabling or enabling the popup. Requires v1.29+
