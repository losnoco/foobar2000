Winamp plugin builds on MSVC 6.0.

*compile the plugin in Debug mode, if would like that the .bin image would not be loaded with LoadFile, but rather with normal LoadLibrary (and that would be possible to debug with MSVC).

The added interpolation discloses much clicks and other sound defects.
It actually becomes noticeable even with linear interpolation.
Some sounds, in my opinion, are spoiled; possibly they are just of a low samplerate.
All sample sounds in banks are stereo; they are all being downmixed to mono.
Volumes of stereo panning are also downmixed to single volume.

Lacks.
Resample table is being generated at start time, rather than at compile time.

The QSFs themselves is not easy to find.
I will bring some info on that.
